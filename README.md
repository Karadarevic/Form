A form challenge I received from Mentor Front-End
I spent some time getting the validation to work, it's not perfect, I used a lot of "ifs" and there's a lot to improve here

1- Change the validity system, I need less "ifs"
2- The error only appears in the first entry that the function identifies as an error, it should throw an error in each empty or wrong label
3- Send the form to a server
